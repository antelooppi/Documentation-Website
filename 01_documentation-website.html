                    <p>I created this website using VSCode and Github Pages. I don't have much prior experience on web development, so I decided to work only with HTML and CSS. I also wanted the site to be light and clear, which led to the minimalistic design approach you are experiencing right now.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing this, all the pages use the same visual structure. The structure consists of three areas: the top navigation bar, the main content of the page and the footer. The visual layout has been build with CSS Grid, using individual dividers for each one of the areas. Inside the dividers, I'm using semantic HTML elements, like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.</p>
                    <p>Learning the basics of CSS Grid was really helpful when designing the visual structure of the website. The full power of it won't probably be fully realized on my simple three-piece vertical layout, but at least I have the option to try more complicated design choices in the future if I wanted. Where CSS Grid really came in handy was in dividing the visual layout into separate sections, positioning them, and adapting them to the browser size in a meaningful way.</p>
