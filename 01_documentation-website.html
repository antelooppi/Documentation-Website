                <h1>Assignment 01: Documentation Website</h1>
                    <p>I created this website using VSCode and Github Pages. I don't have much prior experience on web development, so I decided to work only with HTML and CSS. I also wanted the site to be clear and easy to navigate, which also led to the minimalistic design approach.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing this text, all the pages on the website have been built using the same structure. The main structure consists of two pieces: the top navigation bar and the main content of each page. The navigation bar has been build with &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;list&gt; elements. On all pages, the navigation bar stays the same, containing simple hyperlinks to move between the pages. The main content of each page consists mainly of text, images and videos.</p>
                    <p>I will be developing this site further during the course. The updates will be in terms of content, looks and functionality. One goal I'll try to keep in mind when updating, is to make this site as accessible as I can. I want the site - at least in theory - to be readable not only by me, but by all kinds of people with different kinds of equipment. This is a learning process for me, so I probably won't get it right the first time, but I want to at least try to learn how to use, for example, semantic HTML elements and media optimization when updating this site.</p>
