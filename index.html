                <h1>Hello there!</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to my awesome website. This site was created as part of Aalto University's Digital Fabrication 2026 course, and its main purpose is to serve as a learning diary and documentation of my personal work during the course.</p>
                    <p>Part of the course's learning objectives are related to website development, so I will be updating this site in terms of content, looks and functionality as we go. One goal I'll try to keep in mind when updating, is to make this site as accessible as I can. I want the site - at least in theory - to be readable not only by me, but by all kinds of people with different kinds of equipment. This is a learning process for me, so I probably won't get it right the first time. Nevertheless, I want at least to try to learn how to use things like semantic HTML, color and font choices, and media optimization in a thoughtful manner when updating this site.</p>
